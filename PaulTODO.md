Here's my sort of running todo as I think of it, in rough order

* XML configured multi-switch rather than SVG configured multi-switch
  * properties for drawing and a few classes
  * MOve the other CHSwitch2s
  * Add a multi-text switch which encompasses toggle
* Region SVG Backgrounds
* Gradient Colormaps
* Sublayouts maybe?
* Finish positioning all the sliders with the XML
* Move the rest of the CHSwitch2s over
* Move the LFO section over
* FX routing and FX section
* Patch Browser
* What's left in legacy?

* Find and swap layouts
  * LayoutDIr to '.slo'
  * Scan for Layouts in the userpath and factorypath
  * Meny to swap layouts

* Test Layouts

* API for painting ticks on sliders; and sizing sliders
* SVG for slider handles
* Knobs glorious knobs
* Strings file
* Multi-OSC view (thumbnails!)
* Add 3 more oscillators and have the parameters not break (use the parameter defered chaning)

* Context Help
* Where to put menus? How to specify menus in the layout?

* VST2 as well as 3 and AU
* Installer -> SurgeTwo nomenclature mac
* Windows
* Linux
* Pipeline in BaconPaul land
